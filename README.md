## Goals

- Building relationships with D&I groups to build coalitions. 
- Be a clearinghouse for D&I communications and internships and mentoring across the coalition.
- Go to the individuals (find them), don’t wait for them to look for us. 
- Gather a set of influencers to help spread/create communications.
- Focus on North America-based companies and people.
- Track data to ensure we’re making progress.
- Track contacts, interviews, job offers, internships from individual perspective. Ask candidates where they heard about their job opportunities.
- Can we build a common database to track across the coalition? Can we leverage existing data? 
- Can we get promises from internship providers to recruit from our pool?
- How do we match people with internships? What if they all apply and no one interviews them? 

## Non-goals 

1. Not global.
2. Not redoing things that other D&I groups already do.
